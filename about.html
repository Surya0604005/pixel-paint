    <h1>About Pixel Paint</h1>

    <p>
      Pixel Paint is a lightweight, browser-based drawing and pixel art tool
      built for creativity, speed, and simplicity.
    </p>

    <p>
      It runs entirely in your browser — no signups, no installations,
      no tracking. Just open and draw.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project is designed as a minimal creative playground and a showcase
      of modern web technologies.
